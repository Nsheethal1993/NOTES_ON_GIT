Git clone <url> 
1) makes a copy of a repository 
2)stores it on your computer 
3)a fork creates your own copy of someone else repo

git add 
after cloning and making changes to local repo we want to save the changes made to that file

git commit :git commit -m "messagename"
pushing the saved changes to github repository 

git status:whats currenty going inside the repository 

BRANCHING :DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE CODE 

git push :sends the commited changes to remote repo 
more explicitly could write 
git push origin master
git diff :shows the diff between old and new file.

git pull :retreive changes from remote repo

Merge conflicts :
if 2 developers try to changes same line code change 
resolve coflict : 
git pull 
(says merge cconflict ) 

1) fix the conflict :whih lactual version of code is needed 
git status:
git commit -am "message"
git push 


GIT LOG : tells the history of all commits made

git reset : go to the previous version of code 

git reset --hard <commit>
git reset --hard origin/master (reverts back top remote repo version) and loose all previous version changes 

git reset --hard 7985679 (this number is previous commit number to see that use git log )

BRANCHING :
different version of code 

1)we need to make a chnage 
2) we need to add a new feature

and merge it back to master branch 

git branch :shows all the branches 
to create a new breanch :

git branch <branch name>

switch to another branch 
git checkout <branch name>

git merge :

git merge <branch name>

cueently in master branch but wnt these changes to sheethal branch 

git merge sheethal (which branch we want to push ) the commits chnages from sheethal branch will be merged to master branch

to delete branch 

git branch -D branch name
