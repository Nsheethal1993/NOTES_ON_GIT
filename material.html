    <h1> First Create a new repository</h1>
    <p1>Create +sign in the right corner of github 2) click on new repository 3) name the repository 4) make it private
        or
        public and then click create</p>
        <p2> go to git bash and click git clone uRL (using https url for now</p2>
        <p3> cd NOTES_ON_GIt</p3>
        <p4>ls</p4>
        <p5>touch material.html (name of the file)(touch command helps to create a new file )</p5>
        <p6> code material.html(this code command helps to open material.html in vscode</p6>
        <h2>COMMANDS TO PUSH AND COMMIT</h2>
        <p7> I have tried to push the above changes till p6</p7>
        <p8> 1)I opened git bash
            2) checked the untracked files using command : GIT STATUS
            3) Firstly i want to add material.html file to git repo so i Used command :GIT ADD material.html
            4) Now i want to commit the file so that i can see in github : GIT COMMIT -m "name of the message" , and
            pushed
            to github by using command GIT PUSH
        </p8>
        <p9> way to pull the changes from server to local machine </p9>
        <p10>In organization people make changes and we need to bring that code to local machine to simulate that i have
            created a change in material.html which is pushed to github and i will pull that to local
            command used :GIT PULL
        </p10>
        <p11> way to create merge conflict (wrote in small letters)</p11>

        <p12> i have created a merge conflict by changing same line in local computer and changed same line in github
            difference is i worte p11 in small letters locally and p11 in cqapital letters in github and i tried to push
            top
            github what the chnages i did locally it threw a error saying
            error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Nsheethal1993/NOTES_ON_GIT.git'
            hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
            hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
            hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
            hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
            hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
            so before pushing local chnages : firstly we need to bring github changed locally by using command git pull
            then
            solve merge conflicts now git commit -am "commit changes "
            and the git push .
            <p/12>
             <p13>
                git log : show the history of all commits done
             </p13>
             <h3> git reset --hard and git reset --hard origin/master (will take to previous version of commit file </h3>
                <h4> SWITCHING BRANCHES </h4>
                <p16>git branch :tells current branch ,git checkout nameofthebranch ,git merge (if we want to merge from
                    our
                    branch to master branch)</p16>
                <p14> TO DELETE BRANCHES : git branch -D name of the branch</p14>
